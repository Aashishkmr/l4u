                                        time.</li>

                                        at adverse times without even looking at nozzle(Dont actually spray but
                                        enact).</li>
                                    <li>While using, grip it hard through fingers and spray through thumb.</li>
                                    <li>Keep scanning the areas and keep pepper spray armed/unlocked when you
                                        see potential thret situations.</li>
                                    <li>Only disarm when reach a safe place.</li>
                                    <li>Target the eyes of attacker.</li>
                                    <li>Dont use expired pepper spray(because cannister will loose pressure)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>While buying be known about spray distance, spray pattern, number of
                                        sprays</li>
                                    <li>Differnt spray pattern:</br>
                                        -Stream patterns give good range but require aiming directly at the
                                        face(best: ear to ear).</br>
                                        -Cone mists have shorter range but you don't have to aim as well just
                                        spray up and down around face. But if there is a breeze, a stream is
                                        more
                                        controllable. Mists can be blown off target or even back to the sprayer.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Step on the side after spraying rather than going back because a blinder
                                        attacker will inherently attack in front of himself</li>
                                    <li>Keep opposite arm outsrecthed to push him if he comes on to you</li>
                                </ul>
